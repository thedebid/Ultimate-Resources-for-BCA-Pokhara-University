<h3><font   color=3D"#DC143C">Introduction & Summary</font></h3>
<dd>Computer system users, administrators, and designers usually have a =
goal of highest performance at lowest cost.  Modeling and  simulation of=
 system design trade off is good preparation for  design and engineering=
 decisions in real world jobs.  =

<p>
In this Web site we study computer systems modeling and simulation. We n=
eed a proper knowledge of both the techniques of simulation modeling and=
 the simulated systems  themselves.
<p>
The scenario described above is but one situation where computer simulat=
ion can be effectively used.  In addition to its use as a tool to better=
 understand and optimize performance and/or reliability of systems, simu=
lation is also extensively used to verify the correctness of designs.  M=
ost if not all digital integrated circuits manufactured today are first =
extensively simulated before they are manufactured to identify and corre=
ct design errors. Simulation early in the design cycle is important beca=
use the cost to repair mistakes increases dramatically the later in the =
product life cycle that the error is detected.  Another important applic=
ation of simulation is in developing "virtual environments" , e.g., for =
training.  Analogous to the holodeck in the popular science-fiction tele=
vision program Star Trek, simulations generate dynamic environments with=
 which users can interact "as if they were really there."  Such simulati=
ons are used extensively today to train military personnel for battlefie=
ld situations, at a fraction of the cost of running exercises involving =
real tanks, aircraft, etc.
<p>
Dynamic modeling in organizations is the collective ability to understan=
d the implications of change over time.  This skill lies at the heart of=
 successful strategic decision process.  The availability of effective v=
isual modeling and simulation <font   color=3D"#DC143C">enables the anal=
yst and the decision-maker to boost their dynamic decision by rehearsing=
 strategy to avoid hidden pitfalls</font>.
<p>
System Simulation is the mimicking of the operation of a real system, su=
ch as the day-to-day operation of a bank, or the value of a stock portfo=
lio over a time period, or the running of an assembly line in a factory,=
 or the staff assignment of a hospital or a security company, in a compu=
ter. Instead of building extensive mathematical models by experts, the r=
eadily available simulation software has made it possible to model and a=
nalyze the operation of a real system by non-experts, who are managers b=
ut not programmers. =

<p>
A simulation is the execution of a model, represented by a computer prog=
ram that gives information about the system being investigated. The simu=
lation approach of analyzing a model is opposed to the analytical approa=
ch, where the method of analyzing the system is purely theoretical. As t=
his approach is more reliable, the simulation approach gives more flexib=
ility and convenience. The activities of the model consist of events, wh=
ich are activated at certain points in time and in this way affect the o=
verall state of the system. The points in time that an event is activate=
d are randomized, so no input from outside the system is required. Event=
s exist autonomously and they are discrete so between the execution of t=
wo events nothing happens. The <a href=3D"http://www.caci.com" > SIMSCRI=
PT</a> provides a process-based approach of writing a simulation program=
. With this approach, the components of the program consist of entities,=
 which combine several related events into one process. =

<p>
In the field of simulation, the concept of "principle of computational e=
quivalence" has beneficial implications for the decision-maker. Simulate=
d experimentation accelerates and replaces effectively the "wait and see=
" anxieties in discovering new insight and explanations of future behavi=
or of the real system.
<p>
Consider the following scenario.  You are the designer of a new switch f=
or asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks, a new switching technology=
 that has appeared on the marketplace in recent years.  In order to help=
 ensure the success of your product in this is a highly competitive fiel=
d, it is important that you design the switch to yield the highest possi=
ble performance while maintaining a reasonable manufacturing cost. How m=
uch memory should be built into the switch?  Should the memory be associ=
ated with incoming communication links to buffer messages as they arrive=
, or should it be associated with outgoing links to hold messages compet=
ing to use the same link?  Moreover, what is the best organization of ha=
rdware components within the switch?  These are but a few of the questio=
ns that you must answer in coming up with a design. =

<p>
With the integration of artificial intelligence, agents and other modeli=
ng techniques, simulation has become an effective and appropriate decisi=
on support for the managers.  By combining the emerging science of compl=
exity with newly popularized simulation technology, the   Pricewaterhous=
eCoopers, Emergent Solutions Group builds a software that allows senior =
management to safely play out "what if" scenarios in artificial worlds. =
 For example, in a consumer retail environment it can be used to find ou=
t how the roles of consumers and employees can be simulated to achieve p=
eak performance.

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">What Is Central Limit Theorem?</font></h3>
For practical purposes, the main idea of the central limit theorem (CLT)=
 is that the average of a sample of observations drawn from some populat=
ion with any shape-distribution is approximately distributed as a normal=
 distribution if certain conditions are met. In theoretical statistics t=
here are several versions of the central limit theorem depending on how =
these conditions are specified. These are concerned with
the types of assumptions made about the distribution of the parent popul=
ation (population from which the sample is drawn) and the actual samplin=
g procedure. =

<p> One of the simplest versions of the theorem says that if  is a rando=
m sample of size n (say, n larger than 30) from an infinite population, =
finite standard deviation , then the standardized sample mean converges =
to a standard normal distribution or, equivalently, the sample mean appr=
oaches a normal distribution with mean equal to the population mean and =
standard deviation equal to standard deviation of the population divided=
 by the square root of sample size n. In applications of the central lim=
it theorem to practical problems in statistical inference, however, stat=
isticians are more interested in how closely the approximate distributio=
n of the sample mean follows a normal distribution for finite sample siz=
es, than the limiting distribution itself. Sufficiently close agreement =
with a normal distribution allows statisticians to use normal theory for=
 making inferences about population parameters (such as the mean ) using=
 the sample mean, irrespective of the actual form of the parent populati=
on. =

<p>
It is well known that whatever the parent population is, the standardize=
d variable  will have a distribution with a mean 0 and standard deviatio=
n 1 under random sampling. Moreover, if the parent population is normal,=
 then it is distributed exactly as a standard normal variable for any po=
sitive integer n. The central limit theorem states the remarkable result=
 that, even when the parent population is non-normal, the
standardized variable is approximately normal if the sample size is larg=
e enough (say <font face=3D"symbol">&gt;</font> 30). It is generally not=
 possible to state conditions under which the approximation given by the=
 central limit theorem works and what sample sizes are needed before the=
 approximation becomes good enough. As a general guideline, statistician=
s have used the prescription that if the parent distribution is symmetri=
c and relatively short-tailed, then the sample mean reaches approximate =
normality for smaller samples than if the parent population is skewed or=
 long-tailed. <p>
In this lesson, we will study the behavior of the mean of samples of dif=
ferent sizes drawn from a variety of parent populations. Examining sampl=
ing distributions of sample means computed from samples of different siz=
es drawn from a variety of distributions, allow us to gain some insight =
into the behavior of the sample mean under those specific conditions as =
well as examine the validity of the
guidelines mentioned above for using the central limit theorem in practi=
ce. =

<p> Under certain conditions, in large samples, the sampling distributio=
n of the sample mean can be approximated by a normal distribution.  The =
sample size needed for the approximation to be adequate depends strongly=
 on the shape of the parent distribution. Symmetry (or lack thereof) is =
particularly important.  For a symmetric parent distribution, even if ve=
ry different from the shape of a normal distribution, an adequate approx=
imation can be obtained with small samples (e.g., 10 or 12 for the unifo=
rm distribution).  For symmetric short-tailed parent distributions, the =

e parent population is skewed and long-tailed.  In some extreme cases (e=

30) are needed for an adequate approximation.  For some distributions wi=

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">What Is a Least Squares Model?</font></h3>
Many problems in analyzing data involve describing how variables are rel=
ated. The simplest of all models describing the relationship between two=
 variables is a linear, or straight-line, model. The simplest method of =
fitting a linear model is to "eye-ball'' a line through the data on a pl=
ot.  A more elegant, and conventional method is that of "least squares",=
 which finds the line minimizing the sum of distances between observed p=
oints and the fitted line. =

<p>Realize that fitting the "best'' line by eye is difficult, especially=
 when there is a lot of residual variability in the data. =

<p> Know that there is a simple connection between the numerical coeffic=
ients in the regression equation and the slope and intercept of regressi=
on line. =

<p>Know that a single summary statistic like a correlation coefficient d=
oes not tell the whole story. A scatter plot is an essential complement =
to examining the relationship between the two variables. =

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">ANOVA: Analysis of Variance</font></h3>
The tests we have learned up to this point allow us to test hypotheses t=
hat examine the difference between only two means. Analysis of Variance =
or ANOVA will allow us to test the difference between 2 or more means. A=
NOVA does this by examining the ratio of variability between two conditi=
ons and variability within each condition. For example, say we give a dr=
ug that we believe will improve memory to a group of people and give a p=
lacebo to another group of people. We might measure memory performance b=
y the number of words recalled from a list we ask everyone to
memorize. A t-test would compare the likelihood of observing the differe=
nce in the mean number of words recalled for each group. An ANOVA test, =
on the other hand, would compare the variability that we observe between=
 the two conditions to the variability observed within each condition. R=
ecall that we measure variability as the sum of the difference of each s=
core from the mean. When we actually calculate an ANOVA we will use a sh=
ort-cut formula
<p>
Thus, when the variability that we predict (between the two groups) is m=
uch greater than the variability we don't predict (within each group) th=
en we will conclude that our treatments produce different results. =

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Exponential Density Function</font></h3> =

An important class of decision problems under uncertainty concerns the c=
hance between events. For example, the chance of the length of time to n=
ext breakdown of a machine not exceeding a certain time, such as the cop=
ying machine in your office not to break during this week.  =

<p>
Exponential distribution gives distribution of time between independent =
events occurring at a constant rate. Its density function is: =

<p>
<center>
f(t) =3D <font face=3D"Symbol">l</font> exp(-<font face=3D"Symbol">l</fo=
nt>t), =

</center>
<p>
where <font face=3D"Symbol">l</font> is the average number of events per=
 unit of time, which is a positive number.
<p>
The mean and the variance of the random variable t (time between events)=
 are 1/  <font face=3D"Symbol">l</font>, and  1/<font face=3D"Symbol">l<=
/font><FONT><SUP>2</SUP></FONT>, respectively.
<p>
<B>Applications</B> include probabilistic assessment of the time between=
 arrival of patients to the emergency room of a hospital, and arrival of=
 ships to a particular port.

<B>Comments:</B>  Special case of both Weibull and gamma distributions.

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Poisson Process</font></h3> =

An important class of decision problems under uncertainty is characteriz=
ed by the small chance of the occurrence of a particular event, such as =
an accident. Gives probability of exactly  x independent occurrences dur=
ing a given period of time if events take place independently and at a c=
onstant rate.  May also represent number of occurrences over constant ar=
eas or volumes.  The following statements describe the <I>Poisson Proces=
s</I>:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The occurrences of the events are independent. The occurrence of eve=
nts from a set of assumptions in an interval of space or time has no eff=
ect on the probability of a second occurrence of the event in the same, =
or any other, interval.
<li>Theoretically, an infinite number of occurrences of the event must b=
e possible in the interval.
<li>The probability of the single occurrence of the event in a given int=
erval is proportional to the length of the interval.
<li>In any infinitesimally small portion of the interval, the probabilit=
y of more than one occurrence of the event is negligible.
</ol>
<p>
Poisson process are often used, for example in quality control, reliabil=
ity, insurance claim, incoming number of telephone calls, and queuing th=
eory.
<p>
<B>An Application:</B> One of the most useful applications of the Poisso=
n Process is in the field of queuing theory.  In many situations where q=
ueues occur it has been shown that  the number of people joining the que=
ue in a given time period follows the Poisson model.   For example, if t=
he rate of arrivals to an emergency room is  <font face=3D"Symbol">l</fo=
nt> per unit of time period (say 1 hr), then:
<p>
<center>P ( n arrivals)  =3D  <font face=3D"Symbol">l</font><sup>n</sup>=
&nbsp; e<sup>-<font face=3D"Symbol">l </font></sup>/ n!</center>
<p>
The mean and variance of random variable n are both <font face=3D"Symbol=
">l </font>. However if the mean and variance of a random variable havin=
g equal numerical values, then it is not necessary that its distribution=
 is a Poisson.
<p>
<B>Applications:</B>
<p>
<center>P ( 0 arrival) =3D e<sup>-<font face=3D"Symbol">l</font></sup></=
center>
<center>P ( 1 arrival) =3D <font face=3D"Symbol">l</font>&nbsp; e<sup>-<=
font face=3D"Symbol">l </font></sup>/ 1!</center>
<center>P ( 2 arrival)  =3D  <font face=3D"Symbol">l</font><sup>2</sup>&=
nbsp; e<sup>-<font face=3D"Symbol">l </font></sup>/ 2!</center>
<p>    =

and so on. In general:
<p>
<center>P ( n+1 arrivals ) =3D <font face=3D"Symbol">l </font>Pr ( n arr=
ivals ) / n.</center>

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Random Number Generators</font></h3>
</a>
Classical uniform random number generators have some major defects, such=
 as, short period length and lack of higher dimension uniformity. Howeve=
r, nowadays there are a class of rather complex generators which is as e=
fficient as the classical generators while enjoy the property of a much =
longer period and of a higher dimension uniformity.
<p>
Computer programs that generate "random" numbers use an algorithm.  That=
 means if you know the algorithm and the seedvalues you  can predict wha=
t numbers will result.  Because you can predict the  numbers they are no=
t truly random - they are pseudorandom.  For statistical purposes "good"=
 pseudorandom numbers generators are good enough.

<B>The Square Histogram Method</B>
<br>
We are given a histogram, with vertical bars having heights proportional=
 to the probability with which
we want to produce a value indicated by the label at the base. =

<p>
A simple such histogram, layed flat, might be:
<p>
<pre>
a:********************************32
b:**************************27
c:************************26
d:************12
e:***3
</pre>
<p>
The idea is to cut the bars into pieces then reassemble them into a squa=
re histogram, all
heights equal, with each final bar having a lower part, as well as an up=
per part indicating where it
came from. A single uniform random variable  U can then be used to choos=
e one of the final bars and to
indicate whether to use the lower or upper part.  There are many ways to=
 do this cutting and
reassembling; the simplest seems to be the Robin Hood Algorithm: Take fr=
om richest to bring the
poorest up to average.
<p>
STEP 1: The original (horizontal) histogram, average "height" 20:
<p>
<pre>
a:******************************** 32
b:**************************       27
c:************************         26
d:************                     12
e:***                               3
</pre>
<p>
Take 17 from strip 'a' to bring strip 'e' up to average. Record donor an=
d use old 'poor' level to mark lower part
of donee:
<p>
<pre>
a:***************            15
b:************************** 27
c:************************   26
d:************               12
e:**|****************|       20 (a)
</pre>
<p>
Then bring 'd' up to average with donor 'b'.  Record donor and use old '=
poor' level to mark lower part of donee:
<p>
<pre>
a:***************           15
b:******************        19
c:************************  26
d:***********|*******|      20 (b)
e:*****|*************|      20 (a)
</pre>
<p>
Then bring 'a' up to average with donor 'c'.  Record donor and use old '=
poor' level to mark lower part
of donee:
<p>
<pre>
a:***************|***|      20(c)
b:*******************       19
c:*********************     21
d:***********|*******|      20(b)
e:*****|*************|      20(a)
</pre>
<p>
Finally, bring 'b' up to average with donor 'c'. Record donor and use ol=
d 'poor' level to mark lower part
of donee:
<p>
<pre>
a:**************|****|      20(c)
b:******************||      20(c)
c:*******************|      20
d:***********|*******|      20(b)
e:*****|*************|      20(a)
</pre>
<p>
We now have a "squared histogram", i.e., a rectangle with 4 strips of eq=
ual area, each strip with two regions.
A single uniform variate U can be used to generate a,b,c,d,e with the re=
quired probabilities, .32, .27, .26, .12 .06.
<p>
<B>Setup:</B>  Make tables,
<p>
<pre> =

 V[1]=3Da    K[1]=3Dc    T[1]=3D0+16/20
 V[2]=3Db    K[2]=3Dc    T[2]=3D1+19/20
 V[3]=3Dc    K[3]=3Dc    T[3]=3D2+20/20

 V[5]=3De    K[5]=3Da    T[5]=3D4+ 6/20
</pre>
<p>
<B>Generation Process:</B>
<p>
Let j be the integer part of 1+5*U, with U uniform in (0,1).

If U <font face=3D"symbol">&lt;</font> T[j] return V[j], else return V[K=
[j]].  In many applications no V table is necessary: V[i]=3Di and the ge=
nerating procedure becomes If U <font face=3D"symbol">&lt;</font> T[j] r=
eturn j, else return K[j].

</a>
We need to test for both randomness as well as uniformity. =

The tests can be classified in 2 categories: Empirical or statistical te=
sts, and theoretical tests.
<br>
Theoretical tests deal with the properties of the generator used to crea=
te the realization with desired distribution, and do not look at the num=
ber generated at all. For example, we would not use a generator with poo=
r qualities to generate random numbers.
<br>
Statistical tests are based solely on the random observations produced.
<p>
<i><b>Test for Randomness:</b></i>
<p>
A. Test for independence:
<br>
Plot the x<font><sub>i</sub></font> realization  vs x<font><sub>i+1</sub=
></font>.  If there is independence, the graph will not show any distinc=
tive patterns at all, but will be perfectly scattered.
<p>
B. Runs tests.(run-ups, run-downs):
<br>
This is a direct test of the independence assumption. There are two test=
 statistics to consider: one based on a normal approximation and another=
 using numerical approximations.
<p>
Test based on Normal approximation:
<br>
Suppose you have N random realizations. Let a be the total number of run=
s in a sequence.  If the number of positive and negative runs are greate=

Simulation in general is to pretend that one deals with a real thing whi=
le really working with an imitation. In operations research the imitatio=
n is a computer model of the simulated reality. A flight simulator on a =
PC is also a computer model of some aspects of the flight: it shows on t=
he
screen the controls and what the "pilot" (the youngster who operates it)=
 is supposed to see
from the "cockpit" (his armchair). =

<p>
<font  color=3D"#DC143C"><b>Why to use models?</b></font>   To fly a sim=
ulator is safer and cheaper than the real airplane. For precisely this r=
eason, models are used in industry commerce and military: it is very cos=
tly,  dangerous and often  impossible  to make experiments with real sys=
tems. Provided that models are adequate descriptions of reality (they ar=
e valid), experimenting with them can save money, suffering and even tim=
e. =

<p>
<font  color=3D"#DC143C"><b>When to use simulations?</b></font>  Systems=
 that change with time, such as a gas station where cars come and go (ca=
lled dynamic systems) and  involve randomness. Nobody can guess at exact=
ly which time the next car should arrive at the station, are good candid=
ates for simulation. Modeling complex dynamic systems theoretically need=
 too many simplifications and the emerging models may not be therefore v=
alid. Simulation does not require that many simplifying assumptions, mak=
ing it the only tool even in absence of randomness.
<p>
<font  color=3D"#DC143C"><b>How to simulate?</b></font>  Suppose we are =
interested in a gas station. We may describe the behavior of this system=
 graphically by plotting the number of cars in the station; the state of=
 the system. Every time a car arrives the graph increases by one unit wh=
ile a departing car causes the graph to drop one unit. This graph (calle=
d sample path), could be obtained from observation of a real station, bu=
t could also be artificially constructed. Such artificial construction a=
nd the analysis of the resulting sample path (or more sample paths in mo=
re complex cases) consists of the simulation.
<p>
<font  color=3D"#DC143C"><b>Types of simulations:</b></font> Discrete ev=
ent. The above sample path consisted of only horizontal and vertical lin=
es, as car arrivals and departures occurred at distinct points of time, =
what we refer to as events.  Between two consecutive events,  nothing ha=
ppens - the graph is horizontal. When the number of events are finite, w=
e call the simulation "discrete event." =

<p>
In some systems the state changes all the time, not just at the time of =
some discrete events. For example,  the water level in a reservoir with =
given in and outflows may change all the time. In such cases "continuous=
 simulation" is more appropriate, although discrete event simulation can=
 serve as an approximation. =

<p>
Further consideration of discrete event simulations. =

<p>
<font  color=3D"#DC143C"><b>How is simulation performed?</b></font>  Sim=
ulations may be performed manually.  Most often, however, the system mod=
el is written either as a computer program (for an example click here) o=
r as some kind of input into simulator software. =

<p>
<font  color=3D"#DC143C"><b>System terminology:</b></font> =

<p>
 State: A variable characterizing an attribute in the system such as lev=
el of stock in inventory or number of jobs waiting for processing.
<p>
 Event: An occurrence at a point in time which may change the state of t=
he system, such as arrival of a customer or start of work on a job.
<p>
 Entity: An object that passes through the system, such as cars in an in=
tersection or orders in a factory. Often an event (e.g., arrival) is ass=
ociated with an entity (e.g., customer). =

<p>
Queue: A queue is not only a physical queue of people, it can also be a =
task list, a buffer of finished goods waiting for transportation or any =
place where entities are waiting for something to happen for any reason.=

<p>
Creating: Creating is causing an arrival of a new entity to the system a=
t some point in time.
<p> =

Scheduling: Scheduling is the act of assigning a new future event to an =
existing entity. =

<p>
Random variable: A random variable is a quantity that is uncertain, such=
 as interarrival time between two incoming flights or number of defectiv=
e parts in a shipment.
<p>
Random variate:  A random variate is an artificially generated random va=
riable.
<p> =

Distribution: A distribution is the mathematical law which governs the p=
robabilistic features of a random variable.
<p>
<font  color=3D"#DC143C"><strong>A Simple Example:</strong></font>  Buil=
ding a simulation gas station with a single pump served by a single serv=
ice man. Assume that arrival of cars as well their service times are ran=
dom.  At first identify the:  =

<p>
states: number of cars waiting for service and number of cars served at =
any moment
<p>events:  arrival of cars,  start of service, end of service =

<p>entities: these are the cars =

<p>queue: the queue of cars in front of the pump, waiting for service
<p>random realizations: interarrival times,  service times =

<p>distributions: we shall assume exponential distributions for both the=
 interarrival time and service time. =

 <p>Next, specify what to do at each event. The above example would look=
 like this:  At event of entity arrival:  Create next arrival.  If the s=
erver is free, send entity for start of service.  Otherwise it joins the=
 queue.  At event of service start:  Server becomes occupied. Schedule e=
nd of service for this entity.   At event of service end: Server becomes=
 free. If any entities waiting in queue: remove first entity from the qu=
eue; send it for start of service. =

<p>Some initiation is still required, for example, the creation of the f=
irst arrival. Lastly, the above is translated into code. This is easy wi=
th an appropriate library which has subroutines for creation, scheduling=
, proper timing of events, queue manipulations, random variate generatio=
n and statistics collection. =

<p>How to simulate?  Besides the above, the program records the number o=
f cars in the system before and after every change, together with the le=
ngth of each event. =

Discrete event systems (DES) are dynamic systems which evolve in time by=
 the occurrence of events at possibly irregular time intervals.  DES abo=
und in real-world applications. Examples include traffic systems, flexib=
le =

manufacturing systems, computer-communications systems, production lines=
,  coherent lifetime systems, and flow  networks. Most of these systems =
can be modeled in terms of discrete events whose occurrence causes the s=
ystem to change from one state to another. In designing, analyzing and o=
perating such complex systems, one is interested not  only in performanc=
e evaluation but also in sensitivity analysis and optimization. =

<p>
A typical stochastic system has a large number of control parameters tha=
t can have a significant impact on the performance of the system.  To es=
tablish a basic knowledge of the behavior of a system under variation of=
 input parameter values and to estimate the relative importance of the i=
nput parameters, sensitivity analysis applies small changes to the nomin=
al values of input parameters.  For systems simulation, variations of th=
e input parameter values cannot be made infinitely small. The sensitivit=
y of the performance measure with respect to an input parameter is there=
fore defined as (partial) derivative. =

<p>
<dd>Sensitivity analysis is concerned with evaluating sensitivities (gra=
dients, Hessian, etc.) of performance measures with respect to parameter=
s of interest. It provides guidance for design and operational decisions=
 and plays a pivotal role in identifying the most significant system par=
ameters, as well as bottleneck subsystems. I have carried out research i=
n the fields of sensitivity analysis and stochastic  optimization of dis=
crete event systems with an emphasis on computer simulation models. This=
 part of lecture is dedicated to  the estimation of an entire response s=
urface of complex discrete event systems (DES) from a single sample path=
 (simulation), such as the expected  waiting time of a customer in a que=
uing network, with respect to the controllable parameters of the system,=
 such as service rates, buffer sizes and routing probabilities. With the=
 response surfaces at hand, we are able to perform sensitivity analysis =
and optimization of a DES from  a single simulation, that is, to find th=
e optimal parameters of the system and their sensitivities (derivatives)=
,  with respect to uncontrollable system parameters, such as arrival rat=
es in a queuing network.
We identified three distinct processes.  Descriptive Analysis includes: =
Problem Identification & Formulation, Data Collection and Analysis, Comp=
uter Simulation Model Development, Validation, Verification and Calibrat=
ion, and finally Performance Evaluation.  Prescriptive Analysis: Optimiz=
ation or Goal Seeking. These are necessary components for Post-prescript=
ive Analysis: Sensitivity, and  What-If Analysis. The prescriptive simul=
ation attempts to use simulation to prescribe decisions required to obta=
in specified results.  It is subdivided into two topics- Goal Seeking an=
d Optimization.  Recent developments on "single-run" algorithms for the =
needed sensitivities (i.e. gradient, Hessian, etc.) make the prescriptiv=
e simulation feasible.

building the system right?"  Verification checks that the implementation=

 checks that the model corresponds to reality.  Calibration checks that =

Discrete-event simulation models typically have stochastic components th=

d on the element of interest. This stage performs intensive error checki=
ng on the input data, including external, policy, random and determinist=

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">A Classification of Stochastic Processes</f=

A stochastic process is a probabilistic model of a system that evolves =

randomly in time and space. Formally, a stochastic process is a collecti=
on of =

random variables {X(t), t <font face=3Dsymbol>&#206;</font> T}
all defined on a common sample (probability) space.  The X(t) is the sta=
te =

while (time)  t is the index that is a member of set T.
<p>
Examples are the delay {D(i), i =3D 1, 2, ...} of the  ith customer and =
number =

of customers {Q(t), T <font face=3Dsymbol>&#179;</font> 0} in the queue =
at time =

t in an M/M/1 queue.  In the first example, we have a discrete- time, =

continuous state, while in the second example the state is discrete and =
time =

The following table is a classification of various stochastic processes.=
 The =

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Simulation Output Data and Stochastic Proce=

To perform statistical analysis of the simulation output we need to esta=

process (e.g. the data collected over n simulation runs).
<p>
<font  color=3D"#DC143C"><B>Stationary Process (strictly stationary):</b=
></font>  A stationary stochastic process is a stochastic process {X(t),=
 t <font face=3Dsymbol>&#206;</font> T} with the property that the joint=
 distribution all vectors of h dimension remain the same for any fixed h=
.
<p>
<font  color=3D"#DC143C"><B>First Order Stationary:</b></font>  A stocha=
stic process is a first order stationary if expected of X(t) remains the=
 same for all t.
<p>
For example in economic time series, a process is first order stationary=
 when we remove any kinds of trend by some mechanisms such as differenci=
ng.
<p>
<font  color=3D"#DC143C"><B>Second Order Stationary:</b></font>  A stoch=
astic process is a second order stationary if it is first order stationa=

<p>
Again, in economic time series, a process is second order stationary whe=
n we stabilize also its variance by some kind of transformations such as=
 taking square root. =

<p>
Clearly, a stationary process is a second order stationary, however the =
reverse may not hold.
<p>
In simulation output statistical analysis we are satisfied if the output=
 is <I>covariance stationary</I>.
<p>
<font  color=3D"#DC143C"><b>Covariance Stationary:</b></font>  A covaria=

<p>
Clearly, any stationary process with finite second moment is covariance =
stationary. A stationary process may have no finite moment whatsoever.
<p>
Since a  Gaussian process needs a mean and covariance matrix only, it is=
 stationary (strictly) if it is covariance stationary.

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Techniques for the Steady State Simulation<=

Unlike in queuing theory where steady state results for some models are =
easily obtainable, the steady state simulation is not an easy task.   Th=
e opposite is true for obtaining results for the transient period (i.e.,=
 the warm-up period).
<p>
Gather steady state simulation output requires statistical assurance tha=
t the simulation model reached the steady state. The main difficulty is =
to obtain independent simulation runs with exclusion of the transient pe=
riod . The two technique commonly used for steady state simulation are t=
he Method of Batch means, and the Independent Replication.  =

<p>
None of these two methods is superior to the other in all cases.  Their =
performance depend on the magnitude of the traffic intensity.  The other=
 available technique is the Regenerative Method, which is mostly used fo=
r its theoretical nice properties, however it is rarely applied in actua=

/h3> =

To estimate the long-term performance measure of the system, there are s=
everal methods such as Batch Means, Independent Replications and Regener=
ative Method.  =

<p>
Batch Means is a method of estimating the steady-state characteristic fr=
om a single-run simulation.   The single run is partitioned into equal s=
ize batches large enough for estimates obtained from different batches t=
o be approximately independent.   In the method of Batch Means,  it is i=
mportant to ensure that the bias due to initial conditions is removed to=
 achieve at least a covariance stationary waiting time process.   An obv=
ious remedy is to run the simulation for a period large enough to remove=
 the effect of the initial bias.  During this warm-up period, no attempt=
 is made to record the output of the simulation.  The results are thrown=
 away.  At the end of this warm-up period, the waiting time of customers=
 are collected for analysis.  	The practical question is "How long shoul=
d the warm-up period be?".   Abate and Whitt provided a relatively simpl=
e and nice expression for the time required (t<FONT><SUB>p</SUB></FONT>)=
 for an M/M/1/  queue system (with traffic intensity <font face=3D"symbo=
l">r</font>) starting at the origin (empty) to reach and remain within 1=
00p% of the steady- state limit as follows:
<p>

	t<FONT><SUB>p</SUB></FONT>(<font face=3D"symbol">r</font>) =3D 2C(<font=

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Determination of the Desirable Number of Si=
mulation Runs</font></h3>
The two widely used methods for experimentation on simulation models are=
 method of bath means, and independent replications.  Intuitively one ma=
y say the method of independent replication is superior in producing sta=
tistically a "good" estimate for the system's performance measure.  In f=
act, not one method is superior in all cases and it all depends on the t=
raffic intensity <FONT FACE=3D"symbol">r</FONT>.
<p>
After deciding what method is more suitable to apply, the main question =
is determination of number of runs.  That is, at the planning stage of a=
 simulation investigation of the question of number of simulation runs (=
n) is critical.  =

<p>
The confidence level of simulation output drawn from a set of simulation=
 runs depends on the size of data set.  The larger the number of runs, t=
he higher is the associated confidence.   However, more simulation runs =
also require more effort and resources for large systems.  Thus, the mai=
n goal must be in finding  the smallest number of simulation runs that w=
ill provide the desirable confidence. =

<p>
<font  color=3D"#DC143C">Pilot Studies:</font> When the needed statistic=
s for number of simulation runs  calculation is not available from exist=
ing database, a pilot simulation is needed.
<p>
For large pilot simulation runs (n), say over 30,  the simplest number o=
f runs determinate is:
<p>
<center>
[(Z<FONT FACE=3D"symbol"><SUB>a/2</SUB></FONT>)<font><sup>2</sup></font>=

S<font><sup>2</sup></font>] / <font face=3D"symbol">d</font><font><sup>2=
</sup></font>
</center> =

<p>
where <font face=3D"symbol">d</font><font> is the desirable margin of er=
ror (i.e., the absolute error), which is the half-length of the confiden=
ce interval with 100(1- <FONT FACE=3D"symbol">a</FONT>)% confidence inte=
rval.  S<font><sup>2</sup></font> is the variance obtained from the pilo=
t run. =

<p>
One may use the following sample size determinate for a desirable relati=
ve error <font face=3D"symbol">D</font> in %, which requires an estimate=
 of the coefficient of variation (C.V. in %) from a pilot run with n ove=
r 30:
<p>
<center>
[(Z<FONT FACE=3D"symbol"><SUB>a/2</SUB></FONT>)<font><sup>2</sup></font>=

(C.V.)<font><sup>2</sup></font>] / <font face=3D"symbol">D</font><font><=
sup>2</sup></font>&nbsp; =

<p>
</center>
<p>
These sample size determinates could also be used for simulation output =
estimation of unimodal output populations, with discrete or continuous r=
andom variables provided the pilot run size (n) is larger than (say) 30.=
 =

<p>
The aim of applying any one of the above number of runs determinates is =
at improving your pilot estimates at feasible costs. =

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Simulation Software Selection</font></h3>
</a>
The vast amount of simulation software available can be overwhelming for=
 the new users.  The following are only a random sample of software in t=
he market today:
<p>
ACSL, APROS, ARTIFEX, Arena, AutoMod, C++SIM, CSIM, Call$im, FluidFlow, =
GPSS, Gepasi, JavSim, MJX, MedModel,  Mesquite, Multiverse, NETWORK, OPN=

 SIMSCRIPT, SLAM, SMPL, SimBank, SimPlusPlus, TIERRA, Witness, SIMNON, V=
ISSIM,  and javasim.
<p>
There are several things that make an ideal simulation package. Some are=
 properties of the package, such as support, reactivity to bug  notifica=
tion, interface, etc. Some are properties of the user, such as  their ne=
eds, their level of expertise, etc.  For these reasons asking which pack=
age is best is a sudden failure of judgment. The first question to ask i=
s for what purpose you need the software? Is it for education, teaching,=
 student-projects or research?
<p>
The main question is: What are the important aspects to look for in a pa=
ckage? The answer depends on specific applications. However some general=
 criteria are: Input facilities, Processing that allows some programming=
, Optimization capability, Output facilities, Environment including trai=
ning and support services, Input-output statistical data analysis capabi=
lity, and certainly the Cost factor.  =

<p>
You must know which features are appropriate for your situation, althoug=
h, this is not based on a "Yes" or "No"  judgment.

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C"> SIMSCRIPT II.5</font></h3>
</a> =

<p>
Without computer one cannot perform any realistic dynamic systems simula=
tion.
<p>SIMSCRIPT II.5 is a powerful, free-format, English-like simulation la=
nguage designed to greatly simplify writing programs for simulation mode=
lling. Programs written in SIMSCRIPT II.5 are easily read and maintained=
. They are accurate, efficient, and generate results which are acceptabl=
e to users. Unlike other
simulation programming languages, SIMSCRIPT II.5 requires no coding in o=
ther languages. SIMSCRIPT II.5 has been fully supported for over 33 year=
s. Contributing to the wide acceptance and success of SIMSCRIPT II.5 mod=
elling are: =

<p>
<em>DESIGN</em>: =

<p>
A powerful worldview, consisting of Entities and Processes, provides a n=
atural conceptual framework with which to relate real objects to the mod=
el. =

<p>
<em>PROGRAMMING</em>:
<p> =

SIMSCRIPT II.5 is a modern, free-form language with structured programmi=
ng constructs and all the built-in facilities needed for model developme=
nt. Model components can be programmed so they clearly                re=
flect the organization and logic of the modeled system. The amount of pr=
ogram needed to model a system is typically 75% less than its FORTRAN or=
 C counterpart. =

<p>
<em>DEBUGGER</em>:
<p> =

A well designed package of program debug facilities is provided. The req=
uired tools are available to detect errors in a complex computer program=
 without resorting an error. Simulation status information is
provided, and control is optionally transferred to a user program for ad=
ditional analysis and output. =

<p>
<em>EVOLUTION</em>:
<p> =

This structure allows the model to evolve easily and naturally from simp=
le to detailed formulation as data becomes available. Many modifications=
, such as the choice of set disciplines and statistics are simply specif=
ied in the Preamble. =

<p>
<em>DOCUMENTATION</em>: =

<p>
You get a powerful, English-like language supporting a modular implement=
ation. Because each model component is readable and self-contained, the =
model documentation is the model listing; it is never
obsolete or inaccurate. =

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">System Dynamics and Discrete Event Simulati=
on</font></h3>
</a>
<p>
The modeling techniques used by system dynamics and discrete event simul=
ations are often different at two levels:  The modeler way of representi=
ng systems might be different, the underlying simulators' algorithms are=
 also different. Each technique is well tuned to the purpose it is inten=
ded. However, one may use a discrete event approach to do system dynamic=
s and vice versa.
<p>
Traditionally, the most important distinction is the purpose of the mode=
ling.  The discrete event approach is to find, e.g.,  how many resources=
 the decision maker needs such as how many trucks, and how to arrange th=
e resources to avoid bottlenecks, i.e., excessive of waiting lines, wait=
ing times, or inventories.  While the system dynamics approach is to pre=
scribe for the decision making to, e.g., timely respond to any changes, =
and how to change the physical structure, e.g., physical shipping delay =
time,  so that inventories, sales, production, etc. =

<p>
System dynamics is the rigorous study of problems in system behavior usi=
ng the principles of feedback,
dynamics and simulation. In more words system dynamics is characterized =
by: =

<p>
<ul>
 <li>Searching for useful solutions to real problems, especially in soci=
al systems (businesses, schools, governments,...) and the environment. =

<p>
 <li>Using computer simulation models to understand and improve such sys=
tems.
<p> =

  <li>Basing the simulation models on mental models, qualitative knowled=
ge and numerical information.
<p>
  <li> Using methods and insights from feedback control engineering and =
other scientific disciplines to assess and improve the quality of models=
. =

<p>
   <li>Seeking improved ways to translate scientific results into achiev=
ed implemented improvement. =

<p>
<li>Systems dynamics approach looks at systems at a very high level so i=
s more suited to strategic analysis. Discrete event approach may look at=
 subsystems for a detailed analysis and is more suited, e.g., to process=
 re-engineering problems.
<p>
<li>Systems dynamics is indicative, i.e., helps us understand the direct=
ion and magnitude of effects (i.e., where in the system do we need to ma=
ke the changes),  whereas discrete event approach is predictive (i.e.,  =
how many resources do we need to achieve a certain goal of throughout).
<p>
<li>Systems dynamics analysis is continuous in time and it uses mostly  =
deterministic analysis, whereas discrete event process deals with analys=
is in a specific time horizon  and uses stochastic analysis.
<p>
</ul>
<p>
Some interesting and useful areas of system dynamics modeling approach a=
re:
<UL>
<li>Short-term and long term forecasting of agricultural produce with sp=
ecial reference to field crops and perennial fruits such as grapes, whic=
h have significant processing sectors of different proportions of total =
output where both demand and supply side perspectives are being consider=
ed.
<p>
<li>Long term relationship between the financial statements of balance s=
heet, income statement and cash flow statement balanced against scenario=
s of  the stock market's need to seek a stable/growing share price combi=
ned with a satisfactory dividend and related return on shareholder funds=
 policy.  =

<p>
<li> Managerial applications include the development and evaluation of s=
hort-term and long-term strategic plans, budget analysis and assessment,=
  business audits and benchmarking.
</UL>

<p>
A modeler must consider both as complementary tools to each other. Syste=
ms dynamic to look at the high level problem and identify areas which ne=
ed more detailed analysis. Then, use discrete event modeling tools to an=
alyze (and predict) the specific areas of interest.

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">What Is Social Simulation?</font></h3>
</a>
Social scientists have always constructed models of social phenomena. Si=
mulation is an important method for modeling social and economic process=
es. In particular, it provides a "middle way" between the richness of di=
scursive theorizing and rigorous but restrictive mathematical models. Th=
ere are different types of computer simulation and their application to =
social scientific problems.
<p>
Faster hardware and improved software have made building complex simulat=
ions easier. Computer simulation methods can be effective for the develo=
pment of theories as well as for prediction.  For example, macro-economi=
c models have been used to simulate future changes in the economy; and s=
imulations have been used in psychology to study cognitive mechanisms.
<p>
The field of 'social simulation' seems to be following an interesting li=
ne of inquiry. As a general approach in the field, a 'world' is specifie=
d with much computational detail. Then the 'world' is simulated (using c=
omputers) to reveal some of the 'non-trivial' implications (or 'emergent=
 properties') of the 'world'. When these 'non trivial' implications are =
made known (fed back) in world, apparently it constitutes some 'added va=
lues'. =

<p>
Artificial Life is an interdisciplinary study enterprise aimed at unders=
tanding life-as-it-is and life-as-it-could-be, and at synthesizing life-=
like phenomena in chemical, electronic, software, and other artificial m=
edia. Artificial Life redefines the concepts of artificial and natural, =
blurring the borders between traditional disciplines and providing new m=
edia and new insights into the origin and principles of life.
<p>
 Simulation allows the social scientist to experiment with =91artificial=
 societies' and explore the implications of theories in ways not otherwi=
se possible. =

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">What Is Web-based Simulation?</font></h3>
Web-based simulation is quickly emerging as an area of significant inter=
est for both simulation researchers and simulation practitioners. This i=
nterest in web-based simulation is a natural outgrowth of the proliferat=
ion of the World-Wide Web and its attendant technologies, e.g. HTML, HTT=
P, CGI, etc.  Also the surging popularity of, and reliance upon, compute=
r simulation as a problem solving and  decision support systems tools.
<p>
The appearance of the network-friendly programming language, Java, and o=
f distributed object technologies like the Common Object Request Broker =
Architecture (CORBA) and the Object Linking and Embedding / Component Ob=
ject Model (OLE/COM) have had particularly acute effects on the state of=
 simulation practice.
<p>
Currently, the researchers in the field of web-based simulation are inte=
rested in dealing with  topics such as methodologies for web-based model=
 development, collaborative model development over the Internet, Java-ba=

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Techniques for Sensitivity Estimation</font=

	Simulation continues to be the primary method by which engineers and ma=
nagers obtain information about complex stochastic systems, such as tele=
communication networks, health service, corporate planning, financial mo=
deling, production assembly lines, and flexible manufacturing systems. T=
hese systems are driven by the occurrence of discrete events; and comple=
x interactions within these discrete events occur over time. For most di=
screte event systems (DES) no analytical methods are available, so DES m=
ust be studied via simulation.  DES are studied to understand their perf=
ormance, and to determine the best ways to improve their performance.  I=
n particular, one is often interested in how system performance depends =
on the system's  parameter v,  which could be a vector.
<p>
DES's system performance is often  measured as an expected value.  Consi=
der a system with continuous parameter v  <font face=3Dsymbol>&#206;</fo=

<p>
be the steady state expected performance measure, where Y is a random ve=
ctor with known probability density function (pdf), f(y; v) depends on v=
, and Z is the performance measure.
<p>
In discrete event systems, Monte Carlo simulation is usually needed to e=
stimate J(v) for a given value  v =3D v<FONT><SUB>0</SUB></FONT>.   By t=

2,..., n are independent, identically distributed, random vector realiza=
tions of Y from f (y; v <FONT><SUB>0</SUB></FONT>), and n is the number =
of independent replications.  =

<p>
 We are interested in sensitivities estimation of J(v) with respect to v=
.
<p>
<a name=3D"rapplofsensinf">
</a>
<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Applications of sensitivity information</fo=
nt></h3> =


There are a number of areas where sensitivity information (the gradient,=
 Hessian, etc.) of a performance measure J(v) or some estimate of it, is=
 used for the purpose of analysis and control.  In what follows, we sing=
le out a few such areas and briefly discuss them.
<p>
<font  color=3D"#DC143C"><b>Local information:</b></font>  An estimate f=
or  dJ/dv   is a good local measure of the effect of   on performance.  =
For example, simply knowing the sign of the derivative dJ/dv  at some po=
int  v  immediately gives us the direction in which  v   should be chang=
ed.  The magnitude of dJ/d? also provides useful information in an initi=
al design process:  If dJ/dv  is small, we conclude that J is not very s=
ensitive to changes in  , and hence focusing concentration on other para=
meters may improve performance.
<p>
<font  color=3D"#DC143C"><b>Structural properties:</b></font>  Often sen=
sitivity analysis provides not only a numerical value for the sample der=
ivative, but also an expression which captures the nature of the depende=
nce of a performance measure on the parameter   v .  The simplest case a=
rises when dJ/dv  can be seen to be always positive (or always negative)=
 for any sample path; we may not be able to tell if the value of J(v) is=
 monotonically increasing (or decreasing) in  v .  This information in i=
tself is very useful in design and analysis.  More generally, the form o=
f dJ/dv  can reveal interesting structural properties of the DES (e.g., =
monotonicity, convexity).  Such properties must be exploited in order to=
 determine optimal operating policies for some systems.
<p>
<font  color=3D"#DC143C"><b>Response surface generation:</b></font>  Oft=
en our ultimate goal is to obtain the function J(v), i.e., a curve descr=
ibing how the system responds to different values of  v .  Since J(v) is=
 unknown, one alternative is to obtain estimates of J(v) for as many val=
ues of  v  as possible.  This is clearly a prohibitively difficult task.=
  Derivative information, however may include not only first-order but a=
lso higher derivatives which can be used to approximate J(v).   If such =
derivative information can be easily and accurately obtained, the task o=
f response surface generation may be accomplished as well.
<p>
<font  color=3D"#DC143C"><b>Goal-seeking and What-if problems:</b></font=
>  Stochastic models typically depend upon various uncertain parameters =
that must be estimated from existing data sets.  Statistical questions o=
f how input parameter uncertainty propagates through the model into outp=
ut parameter uncertainty is the so-called "what-if" analysis.  A good an=
swer to this question often requires sensitivity estimates.  The ordinar=
y simulation output results are the solution of a direct problem:  Given=
 the underlying pdf with a particular parameter value  v , we may estima=
te the output function J(v).  Now we pose the goal-seeking problem: give=
n a target output value J<FONT><SUB>0</SUB></FONT> of the system and a p=
arameterized pdf family, find an input value for the parameter, which ge=
nerates such an output.  There are strong motivations for both problems.=
  When  v  is any controllable or uncontrollable parameter [the decision=
 maker is, for example, interested in estimating J(v) for a small change=
 in  v ], the so called "what-if" problem, which is a "direct problem" a=
nd can be solved by incorporating sensitivity information in the Taylor'=
s  expansion of J(v) in the neighborhood of  v .   However, when  v  is =
a controllable input, the decision maker may be interested in the goal-s=
eeking problem: what change in the input parameter will achieve a desire=
d change in output value J(v).  Another application of goal-seeking aris=
es when we want to adapt a model to satisfy a new equality constraint (c=
ondition) for some stochastic function.  The solution to the goal-seekin=
g problem is to estimate the derivative of the output function with resp=
ect to the input parameter for the nominal system;  use this estimate in=
 a Taylor's expansion of the output function in the neighborhood of the =
parameter; and finally, use Robbins-Monro (R-M) type of stochastic appro=
ximation algorithm to estimate the necessary controllable input paramete=
r value within the desired accuracy.
<p>  =

<font  color=3D"#DC143C"><b>Optimization:</b></font>  Discrete-event sim=
ulation is the primary analysis tool for designing complex systems. Howe=
ver, simulation must be linked with a mathematical optimization techniqu=
e to be effectively used for systems design.  The sensitivity dJ/dv  can=
 be used in conjunction with various optimization algorithms whose funct=
ion is to gradually adjust  v  until a point is reached where J(v) is ma=
ximized (or minimized).  If no other constraints on  v  are imposed, we =
expect dJ/dv  =3D 0 at this point .

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Finite difference approximation</font></h3>=
 =


Kiefer and Wolfowitz proposed a finite difference approximation to the d=
erivative. One version of the Kiefer-Wolfwitz technique uses two-sided f=
inite differences. The first fact to notice about the K-W estimate is th=
at it requires 2N simulation runs, where N is the dimension of vector pa=
rameter <font face=3D"symbol"> q</font>.  If  the decision maker is inte=
rested in gradient estimation with respect to each of the components of =
<font face=3D"symbol"> q</font>, then 2N simulations must be run for eac=
h component of  v .  This is inefficient.   The second fact is that it m=
ay have a very poor variance, and it may result in numerical calculation=
 difficulties.

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Simultaneous perturbation methods</font></h=
3> =

The simultaneous perturbation (SP) algorithm introduced by <A HREF=3D"ht=
tp://www.jhuapl.edu/SPSA" >Dr. J. Spall</A> has attracted considerable a=
ttention.   There has recently been much interest in recursive optimizat=
ion algorithms that rely on measurements of only the objective function =
to be optimized, not requiring direct measurements of the gradient of th=
e objective function. Such algorithms have the advantage of not requirin=
g detailed modeling information describing the relationship between the =
parameters to be optimized and the objective function. For example, many=
 systems involving complex simulations or human beings are difficult to =
model, and could potentially benefit from such an optimization approach.=
 The simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) algorithm=
 operates in the same framework as the above K-W methods, but has the st=
rong advantage of requiring a much lower number of simulation runs to ob=
tain the same quality of result.  The essential feature of SPSA, which a=
ccounts for its power and relative ease of use in difficult multivariate=
 optimization problems--is the underlying gradient approximation that re=
quires only TWO objective function measurements regardless of the dimens=
ion of the optimization problem (one variation of basic SPSA uses only O=
NE objective function measurement per iteration).  The underlying theory=
 for SPSA shows that the N-fold savings in simulation runs per iteration=
 (per gradient approximation) translates directly into an N-fold savings=
 in the number of simulations to achieve a given quality of solution to =
the optimization problem.  In other words, the K-W method and SPSA metho=
d take the same number of iterations to converge to the answer despite t=
he N-fold savings in objective function measurements (e.g., simulation r=
uns) per iteration in SPSA.

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Perturbation analysis</font></h3> =

Perturbation analysis (PA) computes (roughly) what simulations would hav=
e produced, had  v  been changed by  a "small" amount without actually m=
aking this change.   The intuitive idea behind PA is that a sample path =
constructed using  v  is frequently structurally very similar to the sam=
ple path using   the perturbed  v .  There is a large amount of informat=
ion that is the same for both of them.  It is wasteful to throw this inf=
ormation away and to start the simulation from scratch with the perturbe=
d  v .   In PA, moreover, we can let the change approach  zero  to get a=
 derivative estimator without numerical problems.
We are interested in the affect of a parameter change on the performance=
 measure.  However, we would like to realize this change by keeping the =
order of events exactly the same. The perturbations will be so small tha=
t only the duration, not the order, of the states will be affected.   Th=
is effect should be observed in three successive stages:
<p>
<font  color=3D"#DC143C"><b>Step 1:</b></font>	How does a change in the =
value of a parameter vary the sample duration related to that parameter?=

<p>
<font  color=3D"#DC143C"><b>Step 2:</b></font>	How does the change in an=
  =

individual sample duration reflect itself as a change in a subsequent pa=
rticular sample realization?
<p>
<font  color=3D"#DC143C"><b>Step 3:</b></font>	Finally, what is the rela=
tionship between the variation of the sample realization and its expecte=
d value?

</a>
<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Score function methods</font></h3> =

Using the  score function method, the gradient can be estimated simultan=
eously, at any number of different parameter values, in a single-run sim=
ulation. The basic idea is that, the gradient of the performance measure=
 function, J'( v ), is expressed as an expectation with respect to the s=
ame distribution as the performance measure function itself.  Therefore,=
 the sensitivity information can be obtained with  little computational =
(not simulation) cost, while estimating the performance measure. It is w=
ell-known that the crude form of the SF estimator suffers from the probl=
em of linear growth in its variance as the simulation run increases.  Ho=
wever, in the steady-state simulation the variance can be controlled by =
run length.  Furthermore, information about the variance may be incorpor=
ated into the simulation algorithm.    A recent flurry of activity has a=
ttempted to improve the accuracy of the SF  estimates.   Under regenerat=
ive conditions, the estimator can easily be modified to alleviate this p=
roblem, yet the magnitude of the variance may be large for queueing syst=
ems with heavy traffic intensity.   The heuristic idea is to treat each =
component of the system (e.g. each queue) separately, which synchronousl=
y assumes that individual components have "local" regenerative cycles.  =
  This approach is promising since the estimator remains unbiased and ef=
ficient while the global regenerative cycle is very long.
<p>  =

Now we look at the general (non-regenerative) case.  In this case any si=
mulation will give a biased estimator of the gradient, as simulations ar=
e necessarily finite.  If n (the length of the simulation) is large enou=
gh, this bias is negligible.  However, as noted earlier, the variance of=
 the SF sensitivity estimator increases with increase in n so, a crude S=
F estimator is not even approximately consistent.  There are a number of=
 ways to attack this problem.  Most of the variations in an estimator co=
mes from the score function.  The variation is especially high, when all=
 past inputs contribute to the performance and the scores from all are i=
ncluded.  When one uses batch means, the variation is reduced by keeping=
 the length of the batch small.
<p>
A second way is to reduce the variance of the score to such an extent th=
at we can use simulations long enough to effectively eliminate the bias.=
  This is the most promising approach.   The variance may be reduced fur=
ther by using the standard variance reduction techniques (VRT), such as =
importance sampling. Finally, we can simply use a large number of iid re=
plications of the simulation.  =

<p>
<a name=3D"rharmonicana">
</a>
<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Harmonic analysis</font></h3> =

Another strategy for estimating the gradient simulation is based on the =
frequency domain method, which differs from the time domain experiments =
in that the input parameters are deterministically varied in sinusoidal =
patterns during the simulation run, as opposed to being kept fixed as in=
 the time domain runs.  The range of possible values for each input fact=
or should be identified.  Then the values of each input factor within it=
s defined range should be changed during a run.  In time series analysis=
, t is the time index.  In simulation, however, t is not necessarily the=
 simulation clock time.  Rather, t is a variable of the model, which kee=
ps track of certain statistics during each run.  For example, to generat=
e the inter-arrival times in a queueing simulation, t might be the varia=
ble that counts customer arrivals.
<p>	=

Frequency domain simulation experiments identify the significant terms o=
f the polynomial that approximates the relationship between the simulati=
on output and the inputs.  Clearly, the number of simulation runs requir=
ed to identify the important terms by this approach is much smaller than=
 those of the competing alternatives, and the difference becomes even mo=
re conspicuous as the number of parameters increases.
<p>
<p>
<a name=3D"rashortcomp">
</a>
<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Conclusions & Further Readings</font></h3> =

PA and SF (or LR) can be unified.   Further comparison of the PA and SF =
approaches reveals several interesting differences.  Both approaches req=
uire an interchange of expectation and differentiation.  However, the co=
nditions for this interchange in PA depend  heavily on the nature of the=
 problem, and must be verified for each application, which is not the ca=
se in SF.  Therefore, in general, it is easier to satisfy SF unbiased  c=
onditions.   PA assumes that the order of events in the perturbed path i=
s the same as the order in the nominal path, for a small enough change i=
n  v , allowing the computation of the sensitivity of the sample perform=
ance for a particular simulation.  For example, if the performance measu=
re is the mean number of customer in a busy period, the PA estimate of t=
he gradient with respect to any parameter is zero!  The number of custom=
ers per busy period will not change if the order of events does not chan=
ge.
<p>
In terms of ease of implementation, PA estimators may require considerab=
le analytical work on the part of algorithm developer, with some "custom=
ization" for each application, whereas SF has the advantage of remaining=
 a general definable algorithm whenever it can be applied. =

<p>	=

Perhaps the most important criterion for comparison lies in the question=
 of accuracy of an estimator, typically measured through its variance.  =
If an estimator is strongly consistent, its variance is gradually reduce=
d over time and ultimately approaches to zero.  The speed with which thi=
s happens may be extremely important.  Since in practice,  decisions nor=
mally have to be made in a limited time, an estimator whose variance dec=
reases fast is highly desirable.    In general, when PA does provide unb=
iased estimators, the variance of these estimators is small.   PA fully =
exploits the structure of DES and their state dynamics by extracting the=
 needed information from the observed sample path, whereas SF requires n=
o knowledge of the system other than the inputs and the outputs. Therefo=
re when using SF methods, variance reduction is necessary.   The questio=
n is whether or not the variance can be reduced enough to make the SF  e=
stimator useful in all situations to which it can be applied.  The answe=
r is certainly yes.  Using the standard variance reduction techniques ca=
n help, but the most dramatic variance reduction occurs using new method=
s of VR such as  conditioning, which is shown numerically to have a mean=
 squared error that is essentially the same as that of PA.

Discrete event simulation is the primary analysis tool for designing com=
plex systems. Simulation, however, must be linked with a optimization te=
chniques to be effectively used for systems design.  We present several =
optimization techniques involving both  continuous and discrete controll=
able input parameters subject to a variety of constraints.   The aim is =
to determine the techniques most  promising for a given simulation model=
.
<p>
Many man-made systems can be modeled as Discrete Event Systems (DES); ex=
amples are computer systems, communication networks, flexible manufactur=
ing systems, production assembly lines, and traffic transportation syste=
ms.   DES evolve with the occurrence of discrete events, such as the arr=
ival of a job or the completion of a task, in contrast with continuously=
 variable dynamic processes such as aerospace vehicles, which are primar=
ily governed by differential equations.  Owing to the complex dynamics r=
esulting from stochastic interactions of such discrete events over time,=
 the performance analysis and optimization of DES can be difficult tasks=
.  At the same time, since such systems are becoming more widespread as =
a result of modern technological advances, it is important to have tools=
 for analyzing and optimizing the parameters of these systems.
<p>	=

Analyzing complex DES often requires computer simulation.  In these syst=
ems, the objective function may not be expressible as an explicit functi=
on of the input parameters; rather, it involves some performance measure=
s of the system whose values can be found only by running the simulation=
 model or by observing the actual system.   On the other hand, due to th=
e increasingly large size and inherent complexity of most man-made syste=
ms, purely analytical means are often insufficient for optimization.  In=
 these cases, one must resort to simulation, with its chief advantage be=
ing its generality, and its primary disadvantage being its cost in terms=
 of time and money.  Even though, in principle, some systems are analyti=
cally tractable, the analytical effort required to evaluate the solution=
 may be so formidable that computer simulation becomes attractive.  Whil=
e the price for computing resources continue to dramatically decrease, o=
ne nevertheless can still obtain only a statistical estimate as opposed =
to an exact solution.  For practical purposes, this is quite sufficient.=
 =

<p>	=

These man-made DES are costly, and therefore it is important to operate =
them as efficiently as possible.  The  high cost makes it necessary to f=
ind more efficient means of conducting simulation and optimizing its out=
put.  We consider optimizing an objective function with respect to a set=
 of continuous and/or discrete controllable parameters subject to some c=
onstraints.  =

The above figure illustrates the feedback loop application. Although the=
 feedback concept is not a simulation but a systemic concept, however, =

whatever paradigm we use one can always incorporate feedback. For exampl=
e, consider a discrete event system (DES) model that employs resources t=
o achieve certain tasks/processes, by only incorporating decision rules =
regarding how to manage the stocks and thence how the resource will be d=
eployed depending on the stock level, clearly, in the system structure t=
here are feedback loops.
<p>
Usually when modelers choose a DES approach they often model the system
as open loop or nearly open loop system, making the system behave as if
there where no superior agent controlling the whole production/service/
process. Closing the loops should be an elemental task that simulation m=
odeler
should take care of, even if the scope does not involve doing it, there
must be awareness of system behavior, particularly if there is known to =
be that the system if under human decision making processes/activities.

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Deterministic search techniques</font></h3>=
 =


A common characteristic of deterministic search techniques is that they =
are basically borrowed from deterministic optimization techniques.  The =
deterministic objective function value required in the technique is now =
replaced with an estimate obtained from simulation.  By having a reasona=
bly accurate estimate, one hopes that the technique will perform well. =

<p>	=

Deterministic search techniques include heuristic search, complete enume=
ration, and random search techniques.

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Heuristic search technique</font></h3> =

<p>	=

The heuristic search technique is probably most commonly used in optimiz=
ing response surfaces.  It is also the least sophisticated scheme mathem=
atically, and it can be thought of as an intuitive and experimental appr=
oach.  The analyst determines the starting point and stopping rule  base=
d on previous experience with the system.  After setting the input param=
eters (factors) to levels that appear reasonable, the analyst makes a si=
mulation run with the factors set at those levels and computes the value=
 of the response function.  If it appears to be a maximum (minimum) to t=
he analyst, the experiment is stopped.  Otherwise the analyst changes pa=
rameter settings and makes another run.  This process continues until th=
e analyst believes that the output has been optimized.  Suffice it to sa=
y that, if the analyst is not intimately familiar with the process being=
 simulated, this procedure can turn into a blind search and can expend a=
n inordinate amount of time and computer resources without producing  re=
sults commensurate with input.  The heuristic search can be ineffective =
and inefficient in the hand of a novice.

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Complete enumeration and random techniques<=
/font></h3> =

The complete enumeration technique is not applicable to continuous cases=
, but in discrete space  v  it does yield the optimal value of the respo=
nse variable. All factors ( v ) must assume a finite number of values fo=
r this technique to be applicable.  Then, a complete factorial experimen=
t is run.  The analyst can attribute some degree of confidence to the de=
termined optimal point when using this procedure.  Although the complete=
 enumeration technique yields the optimal point, it has a serious drawba=
ck.  If the number of factors or levels per factor is large, the number =
of simulation runs required to find the optimal point can be exceedingly=
 large.  For example, suppose that an experiment is conducted with three=
 factors having three, four, and five levels, respectively.  Also suppos=
e that five replications are desired to provide the proper degree of con=
fidence.  Then 300 runs of the simulator are required to find the optima=
l point.  Hence, this technique should be used only when the number of u=
nique treatment combinations is relatively small or a run takes little t=
ime.
<p>
The random search technique resembles the complete enumeration technique=
 except that one selects a set of inputs at random.  The simulated resul=
ts based on the set that yields the maximum (minimum) value of the respo=
nse function is taken to be the optimal point.  This procedure reduces t=
he number of simulation runs required to yield an 'optimal' result; howe=
ver, there is no guarantee that the point found is actually the optimal =
point.  Of course, the more points selected, the more likely the analyst=
 is to achieve the true optimum.  Note that the requirement that each fa=
ctor assumes only a finite number of values is not a requirement in this=
 scheme.  Replications can be made on the treatment combinations selecte=
d, to increase the confidence in the optimal point.  Which strategy is b=
etter, replicating a few points or  looking at a single observation on m=
ore points, depends on the problem.

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Response surface search</font></h3> =

Response surface search attempts to fit a polynomial to J(v).  If the de=
sign space  v  is suitably small, the performance function J(v) may be a=
pproximated by a response surface, typically a first order, or  perhaps =
quadratic order in  v , possibly after transformation, e.g., log ( v ). =
 The response surface method  (RSM) requires running the simulation in a=
 first order experimental design to determine the path of steepest desce=
nt.  Simulation runs made along this path continue,  until one notes no =
improvement in J(v).  The analyst then runs a new first order experiment=
al design around the new 'optimal' point reached, and finds a new path o=
f steepest descent.  The process continues, until there is a lack of fit=
 in the fitted first order surface.  Then, one runs a second order desig=
n, and takes the optimum of the fittest second order surface as the esti=
mated optimum.
<p>	=

Although it is desirable for search procedures to be efficient over a wi=
de range of response surfaces, no current procedure can effectively over=
come non-unimodality (surfaces having more than one local maximum or min=
imum).  An obvious way to find the global optimal would be to evaluate a=
ll the local optima.  One technique  that is used when non-unimodality i=
s known to exist,  is called the "Las Vegas" technique.  This search pro=
cedure estimates the distribution of the local optima by plotting the es=
timated J( v  ) for each local search against its corresponding search n=
umber.  Those local searches that produce a response greater than any pr=
evious response are then identified and a curve is fitted to the data.  =
This curve is then used to project the "estimated incremental" response =
that will be achieved by one more search.  The search continues until th=
e value of the estimated improvement in the search is less than the cost=
 of completing one additional search.
<p>	=

It should be noted that a well-designed experiment requires a sufficient=
 number of replications so that the average response can be treated as a=
 deterministic number for search comparisons.  Otherwise, since replicat=
ions are expensive, it becomes necessary to effectively utilize the numb=
er of simulation runs.  Although each simulation is at a different setti=
ng of the controllable variables, one can use smoothing techniques such =
as exponential smoothing to reduce the required number of replications. =

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Pattern search techniques</font></h3> =

	Pattern search techniques assume that any successful set of moves used =
in searching for an approximated optimum is worth repeating.  These tech=
niques start with small steps; then, if these are successful, the step s=
ize increases. Alternatively, when a sequence of steps fails to improve =
the objective function, this indicates that shorter steps are appropriat=
e so we may not overlook any promising direction.  These techniques star=
t by initially selecting a set of incremental values for each factor. St=
arting at an initial base point, they check if any incremental changes i=
n the first variable yield an improvement.  The resulting improved setti=
ng becomes the new intermediate base point.  One repeats the process for=
 each of the inputs until one obtains a new setting where the intermedia=
te base points act as the initial base point for the first variable. The=
 technique then moves to the new setting.  This procedure is repeated, u=
ntil further changes cannot be made with the given incremental values. T=
hen, the incremental values are decreased, and the procedure is repeated=
 from the beginning. When the incremental values reach a pre-specified t=
olerance, the procedure terminates; the most recent factor settings are =
reported as the solution. =

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Conjugate direction search</font></h3> =


The conjugate direction search requires no derivative estimation, yet it=
 finds the optimum of an N-dimensional quadratic surface after, at most,=
 N-iterations, where the number of iterations is equal to the dimension =
of the quadratic surface.  The procedure redefines the n dimensions so t=
hat a single variable search can be used successively.  Single variable =
procedures can be used whenever dimensions can be treated independently.=
  The optimization along each dimension leads to the optimization of the=
 entire surface. =

<p>	=

Two directions are defined to be conjugate whenever the cross-product te=
rms are all zero.  The conjugate direction technique tries to find a set=
 of n dimensions that describes the surface such that each direction is =
conjugate to all others.
<p>
Using the above result, the technique attempts to find two search optima=
 and replace the n<FONT><SUP>th</SUP></FONT> dimension of the quadratic =
surface by the direction specified by the two optimal points.   Successi=
vely replacing the original dimension yields a new set of n dimensions i=
n which, if the original surface is quadratic, all directions are conjug=
ate to each other and appropriate for n single variable searches.  While=
 this search procedure appears to be very simple, we should point out th=
at the selection of appropriate step sizes is most critical.  The step s=
ize selection is more critical for this search technique because - durin=
g axis rotation -  the step size does not remain invariant in all dimens=
ions.  As the rotation takes place, the best step size changes, and beco=
mes difficult to estimate.

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Steepest ascent (descent)</font></h3> =


The steepest ascent (descent) technique uses a fundamental result from c=
alculus ( that the gradient points in the direction of the maximum incre=
ase of a function), to determine how the initial settings of the paramet=
ers should be changed to yield an optimal value of the response variable=
.  The direction of movement is made proportional to the estimated sensi=
tivity of the performance of  each variable.
<p>	=

Although quadratic functions are sometimes used, one assumes that perfor=
mance is linearly related to the change in the controllable variables fo=
r small changes.  Assume that a good approximation is a linear form. The=
 basis of the linear steepest ascent is that each  controllable variable=
 is changed in proportion to the magnitude of its slope.  When each cont=
rollable variable is changed by a small amount, it is analogous to deter=
mining the gradient at a point.  For a surface containing N controllable=
 variables, this requires N points around the point of interest.  When t=
he problem is not an n-dimensional elliptical surface, the parallel-tang=
ent points are extracted from bitangents and inflection points of occlud=
ing contours. Parallel tangent points are points on the occluding contou=
r where the tangent is parallel to a given bitangent or the tangent at a=
n inflection point.

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Tabu search technique</font></h3> =

An effective technique to overcome local optimality for discrete optimiz=
ation is the Tabu Search technique. It explores the search space by movi=
ng from a solution to its best neighbor, even if this results in a deter=
ioration of the performance measure value. This approach  increases the =
likelihood of moving out of local optima. To avoid cycling, solutions th=
at were recently examined are declared tabu (Taboo) for a certain number=
 of iterations.  Applying intensification procedures can accentuate the =
search in a promising region of the solution space. In contrast, diversi=
fication can be used to broaden the search to a less explored region.  M=
uch remains to be discovered about the range of problems for which the t=

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Hooke and Jeeves type techniques</font></h3=

The Hooke and Jeeves pattern search uses two kinds of moves; namely, an =
exploratory and a pattern move.  The exploratory move is accomplished by=
 doing a coordinate search in one pass through all the variables.  This =
gives a new "base point" from which a pattern move is made.  A pattern m=
ove is a jump in the pattern direction determined by subtracting the cur=
rent base point from the previous base point.  After the pattern move, a=
nother exploratory move is carried out at the point reached.  If the est=
imate of J(v) is improved at the final point after the second explorator=
y move, it becomes the new base point.  If it fails to show improvement,=
 an exploratory move is carried out at the last base point with a smalle=
r step in the coordinate search.  The process stops when the step gets "=
small" enough.

</a>
<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Simplex-based techniques</font></h3> =

The simplex-based technique performs simulation runs first at the vertic=
es of the initial simplex;  i.e.,  a polyhedron in the  v -space having =
N+1 vertices.  A subsequent simplex (moving towards the optimum) are for=
med by three operations performed on the current simplex:  reflection, c=
ontraction, and expansion.  At each stage of the search process, the poi=
nt with the highest J(v) is replaced with a new point foundvia reflectio=
n through the centroid of the simplex.  Depending on the value of J(v) a=
t this new point, the simplex is either  expanded, contracted, or unchan=
ged.  The simplex technique starts with a set of N+1 factor settings. Th=
ese N+1 points are all the same distance from the current point.  Moreov=
er, the distance between any two points of these N+1 points is the same.=
 Then, by comparing their response values, the technique eliminates the =
factor setting with the worst functional value and replaces it with a ne=
w factor setting, determined by the centroid of the N remaining factor s=
ettings and the eliminated factor setting.  The resulting simplex either=
 grows or shrinks, depending on the response value at the new factor set=
tings.  One repeats the procedure until no more improvement can be made =
by eliminating a point, and the resulting final simplex is small.  While=
 this technique will generally performance well for unconstrained proble=
ms, it may collapse to a point on a boundary of a feasible region, there=
by causing the search to come to a premature halt. This technique is eff=
ective if the response surface is generally bowl- shaped even with some =
local optimal points.

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Probabilistic search techniques</font></h3>=

All probabilistic search techniques select trial points governed by a sc=

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Random search</font></h3> =

A simple, but very popular approach is the random search, which centers =
a symmetric probability density function (pdf) [e.g., the normal distrib=
ution], about the current best location. The standard normal N(0, 1) is =
a popular choice, although the uniform distribution U[-1, 1] is also com=
mon. =

<p>	=

A variation of the random search technique determines the maximum of the=
 objective function by analyzing the distribution of J(v) in the bounded=
 sub-region.    In this variation, the  random data are fitted to an asy=
mptotic extreme-value distribution, and J* is estimated with a confidenc=
e statement.  Unfortunately, these techniques cannot determine the locat=
ion of J* , which can be as important as the J value itself.   Some tech=
niques calculate the mean value and the standard deviation of J(v) from =
the random data as they are collected.  Assuming that J is distributed n=
ormally in the feasible region., the first trial, that yields a J-value =
two standard deviations within the mean value, is taken as a near-optimu=

Simulated annealing (SA) borrows its basic ideas from statistical mechan=

left to itself, eventually finds the arrangement of atoms, which has the=
 lowest energy.   The is the behavior, which motivates the method of opt=
imization by SA.   In SA we construct a model of a system and slowly dec=
rease the "temperature" of this theoretical system, until the system ass=
umes a minimal energy structure.  The problem is how to map our particul=

SA as an optimization technique was first introduced to solve problems i=

When performing search techniques in general, and simulated annealing or=
 genetic techniques specifically, the question of how to generate the in=
itial solution arises.  Should it be based on a heuristic rule or on a r=
andomly generated one? Theoretically, it should not matter, but in pract=
ice this may depend on the problem. In some cases, a pure random solutio=
n systematically produces better final results. On the other hand, a goo=
d initial solution may lead to lower overall run times. This can be impo=
rtant, for example, in cases where each iteration takes a relatively lon=
g time; therefore, one has to use some clever termination rule.   Simula=
tion time is a crucial bottleneck in an optimization process. In many ca=
ses, a simulation is run several times with different initial solutions.=
 Such a technique is most robust, but it requires the maximum number of =
 replications compared with all other techniques. The pattern search tec=
hnique applied to small problems with no constraints or qualitative inpu=
t parameters requires fewer replications than the GT.   GT, however, can=
 easily handle constraints, and have lower computational complexity.  Fi=

Interest was renewed in the R-M technique as a means of optimization, wi=

achieved essentially be observing the sample values of the objective fun=

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Gradient surface method</font></h3> =

One may combine the gradient-based techniques with the response surface =
methods (RSM) for optimization purposes.  One constructs a response surf=

The gradient surface method (GSM) combines the virtue of RSM with that o=
f the single- run, gradient estimation techniques such as Perturbation A=
nalysis, and Score Function techniques.  A single simulation experiment =
with little extra work yields N + 1 pieces of information; i.e., one res=
ponse point and N components of the gradient.  This is in contrast to cr=
ude simulation, where only one piece of information, the response value,=
 is obtained per experiment.  Thus by taking advantage of the computatio=
nal efficiency of single-run gradient estimators.  In general, N-fold fe=
wer experiments will be needed to fit a global surface compared to the R=
SM.  At each step, instead of using Robbins-Monro techniques to locate t=
he next point locally, we determine a candidate for the next point globa=
lly, based on the current global fit to the performance surface. =

<p>
The GSM approach has the following advantages; The technique can quickly=
 get to the vicinity of the optimal solution because its orientation is =
global [23, 39].  Thus, it produces satisfying solutions quickly; Like R=
SM, it uses all accumulated information; And, in addition, it uses gradi=
ent surface fitting, rather than direct performance response-surface fit=
ting via single-run gradient estimators.  This significantly reduces the=
 computational efforts compared with RSM.  Similar to RSM, GSM is less s=
ensitive to estimation error and local optimality; And, finally, it is a=
n on-line technique, the technique may be implemented while the system i=
s running.

A typical optimization scheme involves two phases:  a Search Phase and a=
n Iteration Phase.  Most results in analytic computational complexity as=
sume that good initial approximations are available, and deal with the i=
teration phase only.  If enough time is spent in the initial search phas=
e, we can reduce the time needed in the iteration phase.  The literature=
 contains papers giving conditions for the convergence of a process; a p=
rocess has to be more than convergent in order to be computationally int=
eresting.  It is essential that we be  able to limit the cost of computa=
tion.  In this sense, GSM can be thought of as helping the search phase =

Simulation has numerous advantages over other approaches to performance =

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Conclusions & Further Readings</font></h3>
With the growing incidence of computer modeling and simulation, the scop=
e of  simulation domain must be extended to include much more than tradi=
tional optimization techniques.  Optimization techniques for simulation =
must also account specifically for the randomness inherent in estimating=
 the performance measure and satisfying the constraints of stochastic sy=
stems.   We described the most widely used optimization techniques that =
can be effectively integrated with a simulation model.  We also describe=
d techniques for post-solution analysis  with the aim of theoretical uni=
fication of the existing techniques.   All  techniques were presented in=
 step-by-step format to facilitate implementation in a variety of operat=
ing systems and computers, thus improving portability. =

<p>	=

General comparisons among different techniques in terms of bias, varianc=
e, and computational complexity are not possible.   However, a few studi=
es rely on real computer simulations to compare different techniques in =
terms of accuracy and number of iterations.   Total computational effort=
 for reduction in both the bias andvariance of the estimate  depends on =
the computational budget allocated for a simulation optimization.  No  s=
ingle technique works effectively and/or efficiently in all cases.  =

<p>	=

The simplest technique is the random selection of some points in the sea=
rch region for estimating the performance measure.  In this technique, o=
ne usually fixes the number of simulation runs and takes the smallest (o=
r largest) estimated performance measure as the optimum.  This technique=
 is useful in combination with other techniques to create a multi-start =
technique for global optimization.  The most effective technique to over=
come local optimality for discrete optimization is the Tabu Search techn=
ique.  In general, the probabilistic  search techniques, as a class, off=
er several advantages over other optimization techniques based on gradie=
nts.  In the random search technique, the objective function can be non-=
smooth or even have discontinuities.  The search program is simple to im=
plement on a computer, and it often shows good convergence characteristi=
cs in noisy environments.  More importantly, it can offer the global sol=
ution in a multi-modal problem, if the technique is employed in the glob=
al sense.   Convergence proofs under various conditions are given in.
<p>	=

The Hooke-Jeeves search technique works well for unconstrained problems =
with less than 20 variables; pattern search techniques are more effectiv=
e for constrained problems.   Genetic techniques are most robust and can=
 produce near-best solutions for larger problems.  The pattern search te=
chnique is most suitable for small size problems with no constraint, and=
 it requires fewer iterations than the genetic techniques.  The most pro=
mising techniques are the stochastic approximation, simultaneous perturb=
ation,  and the gradient surface methods.   Stochastic approximation tec=
hniques using perturbation analysis, score function, or simultaneous per=
turbation gradient estimators, optimize a simulation model in a single s=
imulation run.  They do so by  observing the sample values of the object=
ive function,  and based on these observations, the stochastic approxima=
tion techniques update the values of the controllable parameters while t=
he simulation is running and without restarting the simulation.  This ob=
serving-updating sequence, done repeatedly, leads to an estimate of the =
optimum at the end of a single-run  simulation.  Besides having the pote=
ntial of large savings in computational effort in the simulation environ=
ment, this technique can be a powerful tool in real-time optimization an=
d control, where observations are taken as the system is evolving over t=
ime. =

<p>	=

Response surface methods have a slow convergence rate, which makes them =
expensive.  The gradient surface method combines the advantages of the r=
esponse surface methods  (RSM) and efficiency of the gradient estimation=
 techniques, such as infinitesimal perturbation analysis, score function=
, simultaneous perturbation analysis, and frequency domain technique.  I=
n the gradient surface method (GSM) the gradient is estimated, and the p=
erformance gradient surface is estimated from observations at various po=
ints, similar to the RSM.  Zero points of the successively  approximatin=
g gradient surface are then taken as the estimates of the optimal soluti=
on.  GSM is characterized by several attractive features:  it is a singl=
e run technique and more efficient than RSM; at each iteration step, it =
uses the information from all of the data points rather than just the lo=
cal gradient; it tries to capture the global features of the gradient su=
rface and thereby quickly arrive in the vicinity of the optimal solution=
, but close to the optimum, they take many iterations to converge to sta=
tionary points.  Search techniques are therefore more suitable as a seco=
nd phase. The main interest is to figure out how to allocate the total a=
vailable computational budget across the successive iterations. =

<p>	=

For when the decision variable is qualitative, such as finding the best =
system configuration, a random or permutation test is proposed.  This te=
chnique starts with the selection of an appropriate test statistic, such=
 as the absolute difference between the mean responses under two scenari=
os.  The test value is computed for the original data set.  The data are=
 shuffled (using a different seed); the test statistic is computed for t=
he shuffled data; and the value is compared to the value of the test sta=
tistic for the original, un-shuffled data.  If the statistics for the sh=
uffled data are greater than or equal to the actual statistic for the or=
iginal data, then a counter c, is incremented by 1.  The process is repe=
ated for any desired m number of times.  The final step is to compute (c=
+1)/(m+1), which is the significant level of the test.  The null hypothe=
sis is rejected if this significance level is less than or equal to the =
specified rejection level for the test.   There are several important as=
pects to this nonparametric test.  First, it enables the user to select =
the statistic.  Second, assumptions such as normality or equality of var=
iances  made for the t-test, ranking-and-selection, and multiple-compari=
son procedures, are no longer needed.  A generalization is the well-know=
n bootstrap technique.

 estimate the nominal J(v) and its first derivative.   Traditionally, th=

 which requires rerunning the simulation model.   Methods which yield en=
hanced efficiency and accuracy in estimating, at little additional compu=
tational (Not simulation) cost, are presented in this site.  The  Score =
Function method of estimating the first derivative is:
<p>
<center>J'(v) =3D  E<FONT><SUB>Y|v</SUB></FONT> [ Z(y(v)) .S]</center>

and f(y; v) is positive for all v in V.
<p>
The Score function approach can be extended in estimating the second and=
 higher order of derivatives.  For example, an estimate for the second d=
erivative based on the Score Function method is:
<p>
<center>J'' (v<FONT><SUB>0</SUB></FONT>)   =3D E Z(y<FONT><SUB>i</SUB></=

<font  color=3D"#DC143C">An Illustrative Numerical Example:</font> For m=

 simulating a reliability system with a known analytical solution.

Consider the coherent reliability sub-system with four components compon=

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Goal seeking problem</font></h3> =

nput parameter will achieve a desired change in the output value.  Anoth=
er application of the goal-seeking problem arises when we want to adapt =
a model to satisfy a new equality constraint with some stochastic functi=
ons.  We may apply the search techniques, but the goal-seeking problem c=
an be considered as an interpolation based on a meta-model.   In this ap=
proach, one generates a response surface function for J(v).  Finally, on=
e uses the fitted function to interpolate for the unknown parameter. Thi=
s approach is tedious, time-consuming, and costly; moreover, in a random=
 environment, the fitted model might have unstable coefficients. =

<p>
For a given J(v) the estimated  <font face=3D"symbol">d</font>v, using t=

<p>
<font  color=3D"#DC143C">The Goal-seeker Module:</font>  The goal-seekin=
g problem can be solved as a simulation problem.  By this approach, we a=
re able to apply variance reduction techniques (VRT) used in the simulat=
ion literature.  Specifically, the solution to the goal-seeking problem =
is the unique solution of the stochastic equation J(v) - J<FONT><SUB>0</=
SUB></FONT> =3D 0. The problem is to solve this stochastic equation by a=
 suitable experimental design, to ensure convergence. The following is a=
 Robbins- Monro (R-M) type technique.  =

where d<FONT><SUB>j</SUB></FONT> is any divergent sequence of positive n=

NT><SUB>0</SUB></FONT> - J(v<FONT><SUB>j</SUB></FONT>) converges to appr=
oach zero while dampening the effect of the simulation random errors.   =
These conditions are satisfied, for example, by the harmonic sequence d<=
FONT><SUB>j</SUB></FONT> =3D 1/j.   With this choice, the rate of reduct=
ion of di is very high initially but may reduce to very small steps as w=
e approach the root.  Therefore, a better choice is, for example d<FONT>=
<SUB>j</SUB></FONT> =3D 9 / (9 + j).  This technique involves placing ex=
periment i+1 according to the outcome of experiment i immediately preced=
ing it, as is  depicted in the following Figure:
<p>
<center>
<img src=3D"GoalSeeker.gif">
</center>
<p>
Under these not unreasonable conditions, this algorithm will converge in=
 mean square; moreover, it is an almost sure convergence.     Finally, a=
s in Newton's root-finding method, it is impossible to assert that the m=
ethod converges for just any initial v =3D v<FONT><SUB>0</SUB></FONT>, e=
ven though J'(v) may satisfy the Lipschits condition over set V.   Indee=
d, if the initial value v<FONT><SUB>0</SUB></FONT> is sufficiently close=
 to the solution, which is usually the case, then this algorithm require=
s only a few iterations to obtain a solution with very high accuracy.
<p>
An application of the goal-seeker module arises when we want to adapt a =
model to satisfy a new equality constraint (condition) for some stochast=
ic function. The proposed technique can also be used to solve integral e=
quations by embedding the Importance Sampling techniques within a Monte =
Carlo sampling. =

<p>
One may extend the proposed methodology to the inverse problems with two=
 or more unknown parameters design by considering two or more relevant o=
utputs to ensure uniqueness.  By this generalization we could construct =
a linear (or even nonlinear) system of stochastic equations to be solved=
 simultaneously by a multidimensional version of the proposed algorithm.=
   The simulation design is more involved for problems with more than a =
few parameters.

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Introduction</font></h3>

<dd>The simulation models are often subject to errors caused by the esti=
mated parameter(s) of underlying input distribution function. "What-if" =
analysis is needed to establish confidence with respect to small changes=
 in the parameters of the input distributions.  However the direct appro=
ach to "what-if" analysis requires a separate simulation run for each in=
put value.  Since this is often inhibited by cost, as an alternative, wh=
at people are basically doing in practice is to plot results and use a s=
imple linear interpolation/extrapolation. =

This section presents some simulation-based techniques that utilize the =
current information for estimating performance function for several scen=
arios without any additional simulation runs. =

<p>
Simulation continues to be the primary method by which system analysts o=
btain information about analysis of complex stochastic systems.   In alm=
ost all simulation models, an expectedvalue can express the system's per=
formance. =

Consider a system with continuous parameter v  <font face=3Dsymbol>&#206=
;</font> V, where V is the feasible region.  Let
<p>
	<CENTER> J(v) =3D E<FONT><SUB>Y | v </SUB></FONT>[Z (Y)]  </CENTER>
<p>
be the steady state expected performance measure, where Y is a random ve=
ctor with known probability density function (pdf), f(y; v) depends on v=
, and Z is the performance measure.
<p>
In discrete event systems, Monte Carlo simulation is usually needed to e=
stimate J(v) for a given value v.   By the law of large numbers =

<p>
	=

<CENTER>	J(v) =3D  1/n <font face=3D"symbol"> S </font> Z (y <FONT><SUB>=
i</SUB></FONT>)  </CENTER>
			=

<p>
 where y<FONT><SUB>i</SUB></FONT>, i =3D 1, 2,..., n are independent, id=
entically distributed, random vector realizations of Y from f (y; v ), a=
nd n is the number of independent replications. This is an unbiased esti=
mator for J(v) and converges to J(v) by law of large numbers.
<p>
There are strong motivations for estimating the expected performance mea=
sure J(v) for a small change in v to v + <font face=3D"symbol">d</font>v=
, that is to solve the so-called "what if" problem.
<p>
The simulationist must meet managerial demands to consider model validat=
ion and  cope with uncertainty in the estimation of v.  Adaptation of a =
model to new environments also requires an adjustment in v. =

<p>
An obvious solution to the "what if" problem is the Crude Monte Carlo (C=
MC) method, which estimates J(v+ <font face=3D"symbol">d</font>v) for ea=
ch  v separately by rerunning the system for each v+  <font face=3D"symb=
ol">d</font>v.  Therefore costs in CPU time can be prohibitive The use o=
f simulation as a tool to design complex computer stochastic systems is =
often inhibited by cost.  Extensive simulation is needed to estimate  pe=
rformance measures for changes in the input parameters. As  as an altern=
ative, what people are basically doing in practice is to plot results of=
 a few simulation runs and use a simple linear interpolation/extrapolati=
on. =

<p>
In this section we consider the  "What-if" analysis problem by   extendi=
ng  the information obtained from a single run at the nominal value of p=
arameter v  to the closed neighborhood.  We also present the use of resu=
lts from runs at two or more points over the intervening interval.  We r=
efer to the former as extrapolation and the latter as interpolation by s=
imulation. The results are obtained by some <I>computational cost</I> as=
 opposed to <I>simulation cost</I>. Therefore, the proposed techniques a=
re  for estimating a performance measure at multiple settings from a sim=
ulation at a nominal value.  =

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Likelihood Ratio (LR) Method</font></h3>
</a>
A model based on Radon-Nikodym theorem to estimate J(v+ <font face=3D"sy=
mbol">d</font>v) for stochastic systems in a single run is as follows: =

<p>
<CENTER>J(v+ <font face=3D"symbol">d</font>v) =3D   E<FONT><SUB>Y | v + =
<font face=3D"symbol">d</font>v</SUB></FONT>[Z (Y)]  =3D   E<FONT><SUB>Y=
 | v</SUB></FONT>  [Z (Y).W]</center>
<p>

where the likelihood ratio W is:
<p>
<center> W =3D f(y; v+ <font face=3D"symbol">d</font>v) / f(y; v) </cent=
er>
<p>
adjusts the sample path, provided f(y; v) does not vanish. Notice that b=
y this change of probability space, we are using the common realization =
as J(v). =

<p>
The generated random vector y is roughly representative of Y, with f(v).=
  Each of these random observations, could also hypothetically came from=
 f(v+ <font face=3D"symbol">d</font>v).  W weights the observations acco=
rding to this phenomenon. =

<p>
Therefore, the "What-if" estimate is:
<p>
<CENTER>	J(v) =3D  1/n <font face=3D"symbol"> S </font> Z (y <FONT><SUB>=
i</SUB></FONT>).W<FONT><SUB>i</SUB></FONT> </CENTER>
<p>
which is based on only one sample path of the system with parameter v an=
d the simulation for the system with v+  <font face=3D"symbol">d</font>v=
 is not required.
<p>
Unfortunately LR produces a larger variance compared with CMC.  However,=
 since E(W)=3D1, the following variance reduction techniques (VRT) may i=
mprove the estimate.  =

<p>
<CENTER>	J(v) =3D  <font face=3D"symbol"> S </font> Z (y <FONT><SUB>i</S=
UB></FONT>).W<FONT><SUB>i</SUB></FONT> / <font face=3D"symbol"> S </font=
>W<FONT><SUB>i</SUB></FONT> </CENTER>
<p>

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Exponential Tangential in Expectation Metho=
d</font></h3>
</a>
In the statistical literature the efficient score function is defined to=
 be the gradient
<p>             =

<center>        S(y) =3D d Ln f(y; v) / dv</center>
<p>
We consider the exponential (approximation) model for J(v+ <font face=3D=
"symbol">d</font>v) in a first derivative neighborhood of v by:
<p>
<center> J(v+  <font face=3D"symbol">d</font>v) =3D E [ Z(y). exp[<font =
face=3D"symbol">d</font>vS(y)] / E[exp(<font face=3D"symbol">d</font>S(y=
))]</center>
<p>
Now we are able to estimate J(v+  <font face=3D"symbol">d</font>v) based=
 on n independent replications as follows:
<p>
<center> J(v+  <font face=3D"symbol">d</font>v) =3D <font face=3D"symbol=
"> S </font> A<FONT><SUB>i</SUB></FONT> /  <font face=3D"symbol"> S </fo=

<p>
<a name=3D"rtechWhatTaylor">
<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Taylor Expansion of Response Function</font=
></h3>
</a>
The following linear Taylor model can be used as an auxiliary model.
<p>
<center>
J(v + <font face=3D"symbol">d</font>v) =3D J(v) +  <font face=3D"symbol"=
>d</font>v.J' (v) + ...,
</center>
<p>
where the prime denotes derivative.   This metamodel approximates J(v + =
<font face=3D"symbol">d</font>v)) for small  <font face=3D"symbol">d</fo=
nt>v.   For this estimate, we need to estimate the nominal J(v) and its =
first derivative.   Traditionally, this derivative is estimated by crude=
 Monte Carlo; i.e., finite difference, which requires rerunning the simu=
lation model.   Methods which yield enhanced efficiency and accuracy in =
estimating, at little additional cost, are of great value.
<p>
There are few ways to obtain efficiently the derivatives of the output w=
ith respect to an input parameter as presented earlier on this site.   T=
he most straightforward method is the Score Function (SF).  The SF appro=
ach  is the major method for estimating the performance measure and its =
derivative, while observing only a single sample path from the underlyin=
g system.   The basic idea of SF is that the derivative of the performan=
ce function, J'(v), is expressed as expectation with respect to the same=
 distribution as the performance measure itself. =

<p>
Therefore, for example, using the estimated values of J(v) and its deriv=
ative J'(v), the estimated  J(v + <font face=3D"symbol">d</font>v) is: =

<p>
<center>
 J(v + <font face=3D"symbol">d</font>v)  =3D J(v) +  <font face=3D"symbo=
l">d</font>v J'(v<FONT><SUB>0</SUB></FONT>)
</center>
<p>
with variance
<p>  =

<center>
 Var[J(v+<font face=3D"symbol">d</font>v) ] =3D Var[J(v)] + (<font face=3D=
"symbol">d</font>v)<FONT><SUP>2</SUP></FONT> Var[J'(v)] +   2<font face=3D=
"symbol">d</font>v Cov[J(v), J'(v)].
</center>
<p>
This variation is needed for constructing a confidence interval for the =
perturbed estimate.

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Interpolation Techniques</font></h3>
</a>
Given two points, v1 and v2 (scalars only) "sufficiently" close, one may=
 simulate at these two points then interpolates for any desired points i=
n between. Assuming the given v1 and v2 are sufficiently close and looks=
 for the "best" linear interpolation in the sense of minimum error on th=
e interval. Clearly,

<p>
<CENTER>J(v) =3D   E<FONT><SUB>Y | v </SUB></FONT> [Z (Y)]  =3D  <font f=
ace=3D"symbol">f</font> . E<FONT><SUB>Y | v </SUB></FONT>  [Z (Y)] + <br=
>(1 - <font face=3D"symbol">f</font>) . E<FONT><SUB>Y | v </SUB></FONT> =
 [Z (Y)]  </center>
<p>
Similar to the Likelihood Ratio approach, this can be written as: =

<p>   =

<CENTER>J(v) =3D   E<FONT><SUB>Y | v </SUB></FONT>  [Z (Y)]  =3D  <font =
face=3D"symbol">f</font> . E<FONT><SUB>Y | v1 </SUB></FONT>  [Z (Y).W1] =
+ <br>(1 - <font face=3D"symbol">f</font>) . E<FONT><SUB>Y | v2 </SUB></=
FONT>  [Z (Y).W2]  </center>
<p>
where the likelihood ratios W1 and W2 are  W1 =3D f(y; v) / f(y; v1) and=
  W2 =3D f(y; v) / f(y; v2), respectively.
<p>  =

One obvious choice is <font face=3D"symbol">f</font> =3D f(y; v1) / [f(y=
; v1)+f(y; v2)]. This method can easily extended to k-point interpolatio=
n. =

<p>
For 2-point interpolation, if we let <font face=3D"symbol">f</font>  to =
be constant within the interval [0, 1], then the linear interpolated "wh=
at-if" estimated value is:
<p>
<center>
J(v)  =3D  <font face=3D"symbol">f</font> . J<FONT><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> +=
 (1-<font face=3D"symbol">f</font>) . J<FONT><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>
</center>
<p>
where the two estimates on the RHS of are two independent Likelihood Rat=
io extrapolations using the two end-points.
<p>
 We define <font face=3D"symbol">f</font>* as the <font face=3D"symbol">=
f</font>  in this convex combination with the minimum error in the estim=
ate.  That is, it minimizes

 <p>
<center>                  =

Var[J(v)] =3D <font face=3D"symbol">f</font><FONT><SUP>2</SUP></FONT>Var=
[J<FONT><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>] + (1-<font face=3D"symbol">f</font>)<FONT><=
SUP>2</SUP></FONT>Var[J<FONT><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>)]
</center>
<p>
By the first order necessary and sufficient conditions, the optimal <fon=
t face=3D"symbol">f</font>  is: =

<p>
<center>
  <font face=3D"symbol">f</font>* =3D  Var[J<FONT><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>] /=
 {Var[J<FONT><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>] + Var[J<FONT><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>]}
</center>
<p>
Thus, the "best linear" interpolation for any point in interval [v1, v2]=
 is:
<p>
<center>
J(v) =3D <font face=3D"symbol">f</font>* .  J<FONT><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> +=
 (1- <font face=3D"symbol">f</font>*) . J<FONT><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>
</center>
<p>
which is the optimal interpolation in the sense of having minimum varian=
ce.  =

<h3><font  color=3D"#DC143C">Conclusions & Further Readings</font></h3>
</a>
Estimating system performance for several scenarios via simulation gener=
ally requires a separate simulation run for each scenario.  In some very=
 special cases, such as the exponential density f(y; v)=3Dve<FONT><SUP>-=
vy</SUP></FONT>, one could have obtained the perturbed estimate using Pe=
rturbation Analysis directly as follow. Clearly, one can generate random=
 variate Y by using the following inverse transformation:
<p>
<center>
Y<FONT><SUB>i</SUB></FONT>=3D(1/v) Ln (1/U<FONT><SUB>i</SUB></FONT>)
</center>
<p>
where Ln is the natural logarithm and U<FONT><SUB>i</SUB></FONT> is a ra=
ndom number distributed Uniformly [0,1].  In the case of perturbed v, th=
e counterpart realization using the same U<FONT><SUB>i</SUB></FONT> is =

<p>
<center>Y<FONT><SUB>i</SUB></FONT>=3D[1/(v+<font face=3D"symbol">d</font=
>v)] Ln (1/U<FONT><SUB>i</SUB></FONT>).</center>
<p>
Clearly, this single run approach is limited, since the inverse transfor=
mation is not always available in closed form.  The following Figure ill=
ustrates the Perturbation Analysis Method:
<p>
<center>
<img src=3D"PERTURBATION.GIF">
</center>
<p> =

<p>
Since the Perturbation Analysis Approach has this serious limitation, fo=
r this reason, we presented some techniques for estimating performance f=
or several scenarios using a single-sample path, such as the Likelihood =
Ratio method, which is illustrated in the following Figure.

<p>
<B> Research Topics:</B>  Items for further research include:
<p>
i) to introduce efficient variance reduction and bias reduction techniqu=
es with a view to improving the  accuracy of the existing and the propos=
ed methods;
<p>
ii) to incorporate the result of this study in a random search optimizat=
ion technique.  In this approach one can generate a number of points in =
the feasible region uniformly distributed on the surface of a hyper-sphe=
re each stage the value of the performance measure is with a specified r=
adius centered at a starting point.
At estimated at the center (as a nominal value). Perturbation analysis i=
s used to estimate the performance measure at the sequence of points on =
the hyper-sphere.  The best point (depending whether the problem is max =
or min) is used as the center of a smaller hyper- sphere.  Iterating in =
this fashion one can capture the optimal solution within a hyper-sphere =
with a specified small enough radius. Clearly, this approach could be co=
nsidered as a sequential self-adaptive optimization technique. =

<p>
iii) to estimate the sensitivities i.e. the gradient, Hessian, etc. of J=
(v) can be approximated using finite difference.  For example the first =
derivative can be obtained in a single run using the Likelihood Ratio me=
thod as follows:
<p>
<center>J'(v) =3D [<font face=3D"symbol">S</font>(Z<FONT><SUB>i</SUB></F=
ONT> W<FONT><SUB>i</SUB></FONT> - Z<FONT><SUB>i</SUB></FONT>)]/(n <font =
face=3D"symbol">d</font>v),</center>
<p>
<center>J'(v)  =3D  [<font face=3D"symbol">S</font>(Z<FONT><SUB>i</SUB><=
/FONT> W<FONT><SUB>i</SUB></FONT> - Z<FONT><SUB>i</SUB></FONT>)]/(<font =
face=3D"symbol">d</font>v. <font face=3D"symbol">S</font>W<FONT><SUB>i</=
SUB></FONT>),</center>
<p>
or
<p>
<center>    =

J(v)   =3D <font face=3D"symbol">S</font>Z<FONT><SUB>i</SUB></FONT>[W<FO=
NT><SUB>i</SUB></FONT><FONT><SUP>+</SUP></FONT>  - W<FONT><SUB>i</SUB></=
FONT><FONT><SUP>-</SUP></FONT>] / {  2 <font face=3D"symbol">S</font> [(=
1+ <font face=3D"symbol">d</font>v)W<FONT><SUB>i</SUB></FONT><FONT><SUP>=
+</SUP></FONT> - (1-<font face=3D"symbol">d</font>v)W<FONT><SUB>i</SUB><=
/FONT><FONT><SUP>-</SUP></FONT>]}</center>
<p>
the sums are over all i, i =3D1, 2, 3,.., n, where
<p>
<center>
W<FONT><SUB>i</SUB></FONT><FONT><SUP>+</SUP></FONT> =3D f(y:v+ v)/f(y; v=
), and W<FONT><SUB>i</SUB></FONT><FONT><SUP>-</SUP></FONT> =3D f(y; v- v=
)/f(y; v).</center>
<p>
The last two estimators may induce some variance reductions.
<p>
iv) Other interpolation techniques are also possible. The most promising=
 one is based on Kriging. This technique gives more weight to `neighbori=
ng' realizations, and is widely used in geo-statistics. =

<p>
Other items for further research include some experimentation on large a=
nd complex systems such as a large Jacksonian network with routing that =
includes feedback loops in order to study the efficiency of the presente=
d technique.
